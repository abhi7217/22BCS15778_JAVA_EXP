# Java Experiments Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Java programs demonstrating core and advanced concepts as per academic curriculum. Each experiment is structured according to the syllabus and covers a wide range of topics from string handling and matrix operations to JDBC, Servlets, JSP, Spring, and Hibernate.

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Java SE (Core Java)
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- MySQL
- Java Servlets & JSP
- Spring Framework (Core DI)
- Hibernate ORM
- MVC Architecture
- Threads and Synchronization
- Lambda Expressions and Streams

---

## 📚 How to Run

### 1. Database Setup
- Install MySQL and create the required tables (`Employee`, `Product`, `Student`, etc.).
- Configure JDBC URLs, usernames, and passwords in your `.java` files where applicable.

### 2. Compile & Run
- Use any Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command line.
- For JDBC programs: Ensure MySQL connector `.jar` is included in the classpath.
- For Servlet/JSP: Deploy to Apache Tomcat server.
- For Spring & Hibernate: Set up `pom.xml` or manually add required JARs.

## 📂 Experiment Highlights

- ✅ JDBC connections and CRUD logic implemented with proper exception handling and data integrity.
- ✅ MVC structure separates model, view, and controller logic for clean code.
- ✅ Servlets and JSP integrated with form handling and database communication.
- ✅ Spring DI and Hibernate ORM used to demonstrate real-world Java enterprise practices.
- ✅ Each program is independently runnable with modular structure.
